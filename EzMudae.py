class Mudae:
    """
    Represents a mudae bot. Primarily used as a factory for Waifu objects.
    Before doing anything with this class, make sure you've configured your mudae bot properly.
    Kakera value must be visible on rolls, for this class to be able to read the messages from mudae.
    If you want to check for claim or roll resets, you must have used the set_timing method at least once
    ----------
    mudae: discord.User
        The mudea bot that this object belongs to.
        This is usually the mudamaid if you got one, and if not, the classic mudae bot.
    user: discord.Client
        The client that's using this class.
    Methods
    -------
    waifu_from(message)
        Returns a waifu from a waifu message.
    is_wish(message, wishes, check_name, check_series)
        Checks if the waifu from a waifu message is part of a list of wishes.
    until_roll(in_seconds)
        Returns how much time there's left until the next roll reset.
    until_claim(in_seconds)
        Returns how much time there's left until the next claim reset.
    async wait_roll()
         Pauses until next roll reset.
    async wait_claim()
         Pauses until next claim reset.
    static set_timing(roll_mod, claim_mod, roll_rem, claim_rem, in_seconds)
        Static method that configures roll resets
